Mapreducce:
MapReduce is a Java-based system created by Google where the actual data from the HDFS store gets processed efficiently.
MapReduce breaks down a big data processing job into smaller tasks. MapReduce is responsible for the analysing large
datasets in parallel before reducing it to find the results. In the Hadoop ecosystem, Hadoop MapReduce is a framework 
based on YARN architecture. YARN based Hadoop architecture, supports parallel processing of huge data sets and MapReduce
provides the framework for easily writing applications on thousands of nodes, considering fault and failure management.

The basic principle of operation behind MapReduce is that the “Map” job sends a query for processing to various nodes in a Hadoop cluster
and the “Reduce” job collects all the results to output into a single value. Map Task in the Hadoop ecosystem takes input data and splits
into independent chunks and output of this task will be the input for Reduce Task. In The same Hadoop ecosystem Reduce task combines Mapped data
tuples into smaller set of tuples. Meanwhile, both input and output of tasks are stored in a file system. MapReduce takes care of scheduling jobs,
monitoring jobs and re-executes the failed task
